[P]: Mutt won't display non-ANSI characters properly.
[S]: Set LANG="en_US.UTF-8" at terminal.

[P]: Mutt starts up with complaint of 'header_cache: unknown variable'.
[S]: The option '--enable-hcache' shall be specified while running ./configure.
     For proper compilation of mutt with this option, an adequate database, say
     db47, shall be installed via macports; also, the command line shall look
     like:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include/ LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib/ ./configure \
       --enable-hcache --enable-pop --enable-imap --enable-smtp --with-ssl

     [The above solution is stolen from
      http://thomer.com/howtos/mutt_on_mac.html and tested to work with mutt
      version 1.5.23.]
