How to make AngularJS project End to End tests work?
AngularJS projects typically use selenium to run e2e tests. The main
components in question are (again!) blocked by the GFW; on Mac, they are
chromedriver (OS-specific, architecture-specific, compressed as zip archive
in distribution [1]) and selenium-server-standalone (java jar file [2]).

Run 'npm run update-webdriver', it will try to download the distribution files
which shall fail. Stop it by Ctrl+C, re-run the command, it will naively
report success (previous downloading attempt creates empty files there, a
second attempt is OK with that and will not try anymore). Now manually
download the distribution files, put into
node_modules/protractor/selenium subdirectory in the project directory, then
extract the former (which is a zip archive). Now we could run 'npm start &'
and then 'npm run protractor'.

Thanks to guys at Taobao, these distribution files are available in their
mirror https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/ at fantastic speed.

[1] The file in question as of writing is chromedriver_mac32.zip on Mac, and
    chromedriver_linux64.zip on Fedora Linux x86_64.
[2] The file in question as of writing is
    selenium-server-standalone-2.45.0.jar.
