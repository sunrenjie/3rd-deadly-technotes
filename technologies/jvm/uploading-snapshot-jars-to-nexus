Uploading snapshot jars to nexus

CloudStack uses 3rd party jars as dependencies. The jar and/or pom files there
can be downloaded, but we could not setup nexus proxy repository for them
(maybe the website contents cannot be indexed, key files are missing, etc).
Therefore, the only way to have nexus serve them is to download these files
and then upload them to nexus. The nexus web interface and rest api only
accept release jar/mom files. For snapshot versions, though, it is possible to
do it via mvn deploy (see reference [1], [2]). The details procedures are
worked out with the help of the references [3], [4], [5]. The reference [6] is
the official guide from sonatype.

====================================
1. fetching the jar and/or pom files

Given the error messsage like "Failure to find
org.midonet:midonet-client:jar:1.1.0 in http://localhost:8081/nexus/...",
search the internet for the string "org.midonet:midonet-client:jar:1.1.0"
(which is of format <groupId>:<artifactId>:<version>), then the jar and pom
download URL will be available. Otherwise ask mvn to download it:

First, disable mirroring by nexus in ~/.m2/settings.xml. Then execute
mvn clean install -P systemvm,developer. It will download everything in
~/.m2/repository. Now the relevant jar and pom files can be located by a
find+grep command.

==========================================
2. allowing maven to authenticate on nexus

have in ~/.m2/settings.xml
<settings>
  <servers>
        <server>
            <id>nexus</id>
            <username>deployment</username>
            <password>sunrj_</password>
        </server>
  </servers>
  <!-- further configurations -->
</settings>

=============================================
3. deploy to nexus via mvn deploy:deploy-file

The groupId, artifactId, and version options are available in the pom file, if
the pom file is provided, they could be droped. The repositoryId shall be
exactly the same string as in the server id in ~/.m2/settings.xml above. You
may use something like Xenus if you like.

We have to upload to snapshots repository. Nexus recommend not to unload
snapshot jars. Actually, the web interface disables it.

execute:
mvn deploy:deploy-file -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=juniper-contrail-api-1.0-20131001.003401-3.jar -DpomFile=juniper-contrail-api-1.0-20131001.003401-3.pom -DrepositoryId=nexus -Durl=http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots

Note: alway run mvn with '-U' to force it recheck the repository updates after
the deployment is performed successfully.
