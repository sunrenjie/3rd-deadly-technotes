How to deploy artifactory proxy server and have sbt run offline:

Download artifactory: jfrog-artifactory-oss-4.1.3.zip and jdk 8 (artifactory
4.1.3 requires Java 8).
Configure artifactory to use Java 8 (via JAVA_HOME), to use port 8082 for web
ui (8081 is already taken by nexus).
Login to artifactory web ui, configure repositories (ivy+maven; see picture
  proxy-ivy-mvn-setup.png at [1]):
  * First add the remote repos, then define the virtual repos with the remote
    repos added. 
  + maven repos has 'Suppress POM Consistency Checks' enabled, though we don't
    know why.

Create overriding repository setting file ~/.sbt/repositories:

[repositories]
  local
  my-ivy-proxy-releases: http://localhost:8082/artifactory/ivy-releases/, [organization]/[module]/(scala_[scalaVersion]/)(sbt_[sbtVersion]/)[revision]/[type]s/[artifact](-[classifier]).[ext]
  my-maven-proxy-releases: http://localhost:8082/artifactory/maven-releases/

Note that the ivy-releases resolver pattern defined here is different from the
default one in defining ivy-releases virtual repo in artifactory (we used the
default value), but it seems OK.

The Artifactory web ui logs are extremely helpful.

To invoke sbt to use our artifactory proxy server:
sbt -Dsbt.override.build.repos=true clean package

When the command runs for the first time, the proxy server will download
everything if necessary (be sure to fire up vpn if necessary now). Afterwards,
this command could be run without internet connection.

========================
How to migrate a artifactory installations from one machine to another?

Migrating artifactory installations allows re-using of cached download files,
configurations, etc. But there are things more than merely coping the
installation directory:

+ Set JAVA_HOME variable. For convinience, put the line at the beginning of
  the file bin/artifactory.sh; for example: 'export JAVA_HOME=~/bin/jdk1.8'.
+ Certain configurations uses absolute paths. The only one spotted thus far is
  the 'url' option in etc/storage.properties.
+ Under artifactory/tomcat directory, there may be a absolute symlink, change
  it to a relative one or simply correct it.
