Artifactory related stuff

Now that artifactory is our dominant maven server, we shall maintain knowledge
around it.

=================================
Updating, copying, and relocating

Artifactory can be portable with trivial efforts and a bit of care.

Always follow the official reference:

More notes:
0. Export data from web page has always being a good idea. The system part is
  small in size, yet the repository part can be huge as it contains all cached
  files. It is safe to skip the repository part and re-download the stuff from
  scratch.
1. The daily/weekly backups can be disabled and the backups sub-folder simply
  removed to save disk storage and labor.
2. When copying from one place/OS to another, open etc/storage.properties and
  change database url if necessary. It has to be absolute.
3. May need to set JAVA_HOME if necessary.
4. It seems difficult to back up the data sub-folder directly; use the export/
  import functionalities provided by the web interface instead.
