eglibc (as shipped in debian) related notes started at 20130527

1) While I was trying to get myself familiar with the pthread library in eglibc,
I searched again and again, yet failed to locate the definition for a pthread
function, say pthread_mutex_lock(). After some messing around and grepping, I
found this line:
nptl/pthread_mutex_lock.c:473:strong_alias (__pthread_mutex_lock, pthread_mutex_lock)

It turned out that it is the convention of eglibc to define the library functions
as having a prefix of two additional underscore characters. Then the library
facility strong_alias (defined in include/libc-symbols.h) perform such
symbol conversion.

UPDATE-20130528:
When it comes to pthread_create, the conversion is different:
pthread_create.c:443:__pthread_create_2_1 (newthread, attr, start_routine, arg)
pthread_create.c:563:versioned_symbol (libpthread, __pthread_create_2_1, pthread_create, GLIBC_2_1);

Some extra effort is made to maintain binary compatibility.
