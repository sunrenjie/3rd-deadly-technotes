Questions:
1. How could we use 'bzr branch' correctly?
The following command hangs:
bzr branch https://code.launchpad.net/~utouch-packaging/utouch-qml/ubuntu

2. How to print lib name in gdb when dbgsym are installed?

3. Output of 'apt-get source' is misleading; do we still need
'dpkg-source -x foo_version-revision.dsc'?
No; answered in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete
