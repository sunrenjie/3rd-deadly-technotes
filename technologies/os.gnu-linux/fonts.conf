<!--
Note that this file is encumbered. The original content is copied from
somewhere, maybe some Ubuntu forum (note some Ubuntu-specific settings). Then
we made several personal customizations. Later on we found that the settings
we made in GUI interface in 'Preferences' => 'Look and Feel' => 'Appearance'
also find their ways here. Also, some contents may already be available in the
fontconfig package and enabled in /etc/fonts. All these improved fontconfig
management leaves our personalized settings unclean and overly clever. But a
clean solution may be duplicating what's available in fontconfig and thus is
not worth the trouble. Since fontconfig seems robust enough to be silently
compatible with our settings, we will leave the file largely as is, except for
the font substitutions part which largely reflects our taste.

Originally this file is supposed to be placed as ~/.fonts.conf in order for it
to take effect. Later on it is found that, if ~/.fonts.conf is created in
advance, some clever system management code would move it to
~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf and create a symlink to it back as
~/.fonts.conf. Seems a bit surprising, yet silently fine.

<!-- Hint style is the amount of influence the hinting mode has. Hinting
can be set to: "hintfull", "hintmedium", "hintslight" and "hintnone".
With BCI hinting, "hintfull" should work best for most fonts.
With the autohinter, "hintslight" is recommended. -->

<!-- Subpixel rendering effectively triples the horizontal (or vertical)
resolution for fonts by making use of subpixels. The autohinter and
subpixel rendering are not designed to work together and should not
be used in combination. Most monitors manufactured today use the
Red, Green, Blue (RGB) specification. Fontconfig will need to know
your monitor type to be able to display your fonts correctly.
Values are "rgb" (most common), "bgr", "vrgb" (vertical), "vbgr",
"unknown" or "none". -->

<!-- When using subpixel rendering, you should enable the LCD filter,
which is designed to reduce colour fringing. The "lcddefault" filter
will work for most users. Other filters are available that can be
used in special situations: "lcdlight"; a lighter filter ideal for
fonts that look too bold or fuzzy; "lcdlegacy", the original Cairo
filter; "lcdnone" to disable it entirely. -->
