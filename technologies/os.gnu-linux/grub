[TIPS]

1. How to load grub2 from legacy grub (e.g., grldr for Windows XP/2003)?
   Solution: at grldr command line prompt, enter:
   kernel (hdx,y)/path/to/core.img
   boot

2. How to load Windows from a non-first drive?
   Solutions (assuming the Windows is in the 3rd drive, partition 1):
   grub1:
     map (hd2) (hd0)
     root (hd2,0)
     chainloader +1
     boot
   grub2:
     drivemap (hd2) (hd0)
     set root=(hd2,msdos1)
     chainloader +1
     boot

HOWTO: Installing Fedora LiveCD Workstation [1] to PC with grldr:

1. Fetch the LiveCD Workstation installation disc iso image file, place it in
   a fat/ext file system. [2][6]
2. Locate the isolinux folder from the Server installation disc (of the same
   version as the LiveCD disc), copy out vmlinuz* and initrd* to somewhere that
   can be referenced by grldr. [3]
3. At grldr command line prompt, enter:
   kernel (hdx,y)/path/to/vmlinuz repo=hd:/dev/sda5:/ [4][5]
   initrd (hdx,y)/path/to/initrd
   boot
4. After initial configuration, we may finally be able to land on the livecd
   system. Run 'liveinst' command as root to install the livecd system on to
   hard disk. [5]

NOTES:
1. Tested OK on Fedora 20, 22, 23, 26. LiveCD with Mate Desktop booted using
   this HOWTO will prompt for password we could never manage to guess. Server
   edition may work, but no test is performed yet.
2. Supported file system for placing of the iso image file is msdos fat, linux
   ext. This indicates that if the iso file is larger than 4GB, the only choice
   will be linux ext. Mysteriously, the NTFS driver is included in the initrd,
   yet placing iso file on NTFS is not supported.
3. This means the vmlinuz and initrd files can be placed on an NTFS partition.
4. The device name can be obtained when running the LiveCD Fedora, or otherwise
   has to be guessed.
5. Other options may be needed based on trial-and-error tests. For example, on
   HP Proliant DL380G6, 'modprobe.blacklist=cnic,bnx2i' is required.
6. During installation to hard disk, avoid touching or mouting any of the
   partitions on the device where the ISO installation file is at. Put it the
   other way, don't place the ISO installation file on any device that you may
   touch or mount. Otherwise the installer may complain of being unable to
   umount some devices.

================================================================================
HOWTO: Installing "Fedora 20" to PC with grub2:

0. Reserver empty disk spaces and back up everything.
1. Have grub2 installed.
2. Get the installation ISO file and put it to some place in the file system.
3. Either a) create a grub2 entry containing the following or b) type the
   commands in the curly braces manually at grub2 prompt. Note that the
   partition string shall be customized according to your configurations.
4. The installation begins.

menuentry "Fedora 20 (DVD)" {
 insmod loopback
 insmod iso9660
 set isofile="/Fedora-15-x86_64-DVD.iso"
 loopback loop (hd0,2)$isofile
 linux (loop)/isolinux/vmlinuz repo=hd:/dev/sda6:/
 initrd (loop)/isolinux/initrd.img
}

HOWTO: Loading Windows PE ISO and DOS IMG files with grub 1 (including grldr):

For ISO images:
map --mem /path/to/image.iso (hd32)
map --hook
chainloader (hd32)
boot

For DOS images:
map --mem /path/to/image.img (fd0)
map --hook
chainloader (fd0)+1
rootnoverify (fd0)
boot

Note the difference in the chainloader command and the IMG-only rootnoverify
command.

====================================
HOWTO: boot from grub2 rescue prompt

We may drop to grub2 rescue prompt if the root device name is changed because
of some partition table change(s). Steps to go:
1. ls # to determine the new root device name, e.g. (hd0,msdos2)
2. set root=(hd0,msdos2)
3. set prefix=(hd0,msdos2)/boot/grub2  # the grub2 directory, verified by 'ls'
4. insmod normal
5. normal

And if there is no damage to the grub files in file system, we will now be in
grub menu. Boot the Linux and go on to fix grub2 installation.

===============================================================================
HOWTO: fix grub2 (on partition table changes, etc.):

Firstly, it is assumed that the relevant file systems remain intact (only
partition table and hence device names changed).

1. Boot LiveCD (see instructions above); mount the root filesystem (say /mnt).
2. Validate entries in /etc/fstab, especially UUIDs.
3. Re-install grub onto the MBR of the disk:
   grub2-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdX [1] [2]
   (where /dev/sdX is the device path of the disk)
4. Re-generate the configuration file /boot/grub2/grub.cfg for the target file
   system from /etc/default/grub; run it only if necessary:
   grub2-mkconfig -o /mnt/boot/grub2/grub.cfg [3]

[1][3] On older systems, the commands may be grub-install and grub-mkconfig.
[2] If we have managed to boot the OS we intend to fix, the command will
    become "grub2-install --root-directory=/ /dev/sdX".

=================
/etc/default/grub

It holds default values used for (re-)generating grub2 configuration file
/boot/grub2/grub.cfg. Some kernel parameters can be set in this file within the
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX option.

===========================
Prominant kernel parameters

They are specified at the kernel (grub1) or linux (grub2) command line:
1. video=1920x1080  # Override framebuffer video defaults; vconsole resolution
2. repo=hd:/dev/sdb7:/f26  # specify Fedora installation disc ISO file path
3. modprobe.blacklist=radeon  # requires to ban the kernel module(s)
4. radeon.runpm=0  # set module attribute
5. quite  # being less verbose
6. single  # drop to single user mode
7. rd.live.overlay.size  # Fedora LiveCD: the root ram disk size [1]

[1] On Fedora 27 LiveCD, the default value is 32768, corresponding to 0.5GB ram
disk. In a system with 16GB memory, we've managed to set the value to 327680
and get a root disk with roughly 6GB (not precisely 5GB) in total and 2GB free.
This allows to download and install plenty of packages for testing.

About grub4dos

We've been using grub4dos 0.4.4-20090331. But this version hits a problem while
loading kernel files from ext4 partitions. These ext4 partitions are created by
Fedora 26. While trying to load kernel files from there, grldr complains of
"Filesystem compatibility error, cannot read whole file". One ext4 partition
created by Fedora 23 does have such problem. We suspect that there is some
fundamental change between the two versions, but have not verified it (seems
that ext4 64-bit is to blame; the feature itself can be disabled somehow).

Solution: Fortunately, some one else is still actively working on grub4dos at
http://grub4dos.chenall.net/. While trying grldr+grldr.mbr files from
grub4dos-0.4.6a-2017-06-25.7z (the latest version from the site as of now), the
problem is gone and all is fine.
