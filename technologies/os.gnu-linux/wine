App support
===========

[OED on CDROM v1.14]

According to experiments, Wine 1.6.2 is tested to support OED 1.14 to the point
that majority contents are displayed fine, except:
1. Pop-up menus after click on the menu bar are not adjacent to menu bar.
2. Characters that should be displayed in font 'Porson Greek One' (as in
   Windows) is not rendered correctly; instead, font like 'Symbol' is used.

Other versions that do not work is 1.5.31 and 1.7.5: the winevdm.exe process
simply crashes.

============
Installation

Compilation dependencies (AFAIN):
In apt-based distros (debian, ubuntu, etc), a simple command will do:
'apt-get build-dep wine'.

For Fedora 20 x86_64, install these libs [1]:
