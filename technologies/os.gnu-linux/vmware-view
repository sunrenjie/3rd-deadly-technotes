VMware View Client @ 20141217

For GNU/Linux platform, the client is officially available for ubuntu i386
architecture. These days we mostly use x86_64 architecture. On such systems,
the client requires a lot of 32-bit libraries if they are not installed
already. A simple trick would be to install dependent libs for another 32-bit
app, say wine. Alternatively, if you managed to install all dependent packages
after lengthy trial-and-error activities, you can figure out the exact list
using tools like ldd.

==========================
Fedora x86_64 specific [1]

1. The installation deb file can be converted to rpm by 'alien' command.
2. A libopenssl0_9_8-32bit-0.9.8x-5.1.3.x86_64.rpm package from opensuse shall
   be manually installed.
3. To figure out the exact depend list:

   ldd /usr/bin/vmware-view.bin  | awk 'NF==4{print $3}' | \
     while read f; do rpm -qf $(readlink -f $f) \
     --queryformat='%{NAME}.%{ARCH}\n'; done | sort | uniq

   This result for Fedora 20 will resemble the following:

   atk.i686 cairo.i686 expat.i686 fontconfig.i686 freetype-freeworld.i686
   gdk-pixbuf2.i686 glib2.i686 glibc.i686 graphite2.i686 gtk2.i686
   harfbuzz.i686 libdrm.i686 libffi.i686 libgcc.i686
   libopenssl0_9_8-32bit.x86_64 libpng12.i686 libpng.i686 libselinux.i686
   libstdc++.i686 libwayland-client.i686 libwayland-server.i686 libX11.i686
   libXau.i686 libxcb.i686 libXcomposite.i686 libXcursor.i686 libXdamage.i686
   libXext.i686 libXfixes.i686 libXi.i686 libXinerama.i686 libxml2.i686
   libXrandr.i686 libXrender.i686 libXxf86vm.i686 mesa-libEGL.i686
   mesa-libgbm.i686 mesa-libglapi.i686 mesa-libGL.i686 pango.i686 pcre.i686
   pixman.i686 xz-libs.i686 zlib.i686

   This list is a good point to start with.
4. Installation of the vmware-view-client-xxx.rpm may fail with message that
   file '/', '/usr/lib', '/usr/lib' conflicts with files from package
   filesystem. This is certainly wierd. Just add '--force' to the 'rpm -i'
   command.

===============
64-bit specific

1. Even after successful install, the vmware-view program will complain of
   something like 'Unable to locate them engine in module_path: "murrine"'.
   In such case, the 32-bit gtk engine for your theme has to be installed (the
   64-bit package must have been installed along with the desktop). On
   Fedora, it may be something like gtk-murrine-engine.i686, while on Ubuntu
   its name will resemble gtk2-engines-murrine:i386 .

Update 20170717:
The client version 2.2.0 does not work on Fedora 26. Fortunately, VMWare
released a newer version 4.5.0 that works.
