Install Fedora GNU/Linux of our own taste

We keep installation and configuration info here to make further repeats
easier (targeting Fedora 23 by default unless otherwise mentioned explicitly).

=====================
YUM Software packages

rpm fusion:
rpm -i http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-23.noarch.rpm
rpm -i http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-23.noarch.rpm

# basic system groups
yum groupinstall "Mate" base-x

# system
yum install mariadb-server libreoffice telnet p7zip p7zip-plugins wget lsb \
  screen rdesktop mplayer gnome-mplayer ibus-pinyin NetworkManager-vpnc \
  alsa-plugins-pulseaudio git freetype-freeworld

# ia32 support (wine, vmware-view, etc)
yum install gtk2.i686 gtk3.i686 libpng12.i686 alsa-lib.i686 gdk-pixbuf2.i686 \
  libxkbfile.i686 glibc.i686 cairo.i686 freetype-freeworld \
  gtk-murrine-engine.i686

# for installing python packages
yum install gcc redhat-rpm-config mariadb-devel libxml2 libxslt libxml2-devel \
  libxslt-devel python3-devel python-devel python-virtualenv


Special notes:
1. MPlayer and freetype-freeworld are from rpmfusion.
2. alsa-plugins-pulseaudio is required for mplayer to play MP3 files normally.

Other software

+ AMD graphic driver
  + The latest official driver as of this write supports kernel up to 3.19.
    But Fedora 23 has 4.2.6. This means we will have to resort to the driver
    bundled with Fedora (xorg-x11-drv-ati), which just works.
+ Oracle JDK
+ Firefox
  + Bookmark Sync'ing
  + Plugins (@ ~/.mozilla/plugins):
    + Flash: downloaded from Adobe site; cp libflashplayer.so =>
    + Java: ln -s jdk/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so =>
  + Add-ons (can be sync'ed together with bookmarks):
    + 'EPUBReader'
    + 'FoxyProxy Standard',
    + 'Theme Font & Size Changer'
    + 'User Agent Switcher'
+ Google Chrome (extensions in the official store cannot be downloaded for
  offline use; has to be downloaded from sources elsewhere)
  + Extensions:
    + Ultimate User Agent Switcher, URL Sniffer
    + youkuhtml5player (http://zythum.sinaapp.com/youkuhtml5playerbookmark/)
+ Wine (specific version required for certain app) and .wine dir [1]
+ VMware View Client [2]
+ Fonts
+ Other open source software that we'd prefer to download and install all by
  ourselves (maven, scala, etc; mainly java based).
  + Those in yum repos will certain have openjdk as dependency. We use our own
    Oracle JDK and therefore has to maintain our own Java softwares.
+ Software available directly from git repos (notes, bypy, etc).

Configurations

vi /etc/selinux/config => disabled
cp .bash_profile .bashrc .gitconfig .gitignore .vimrc .my.cnf .ssh/config \
  .config/fontconfig/fonts.conf .m2/settings.xml .sbt/repositories \
  .sbt/0.13/plugins/build.sbt .gradle/gradle.properties \
  .gradle/init.d/artifactory.gradle .PyCharm50/config .IntelliJIdea15/config
  + Use this transfer technique to avoid the headache of directory hierarchies:
    + cd /mnt1/home/r/  # old home dir
    + tar -cf - xxx yyy | tar -xf - -C /home/r/ # to new home dir
cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config # multiple port, UseDNS no, etc.

# To boot into GUI login (remove destination file if it already exists)
ln -sf /usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target /etc/systemd/system/default.target
