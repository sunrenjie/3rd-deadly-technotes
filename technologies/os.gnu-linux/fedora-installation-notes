Install Fedora GNU/Linux of our own taste

We keep installation and configuration info here to make further repeats
easier (targeting Fedora 23 by default unless otherwise mentioned explicitly).


===========================
Installation of Fedora 23 from hard disk/USB drive

Steps:
0) Download the server iso file, put it on some ext/fat partition accessible
by the installer.

The installer seems to have weaker and weaker ability to recognize complex
partitions for installation targets, as version bumps. To avoid trouble, it
is better we put the installation ISO file on a disk that has very simple
partitioning scheme and contains no installation target partition. An USB
FAT32 thumb drive will be ideal.

1) Extract isolinux folder from the iso, put it somewhere accessible from
grub.

We typically use windows+grldr for bootstrapping the installation. In such
case, we might put it on any NTFS/FAT/EXT partition.

2) Boot computer with grub. load kernel/initrd from the isolinux folder. In
particular, the kernel command line shall be like:
kernel /path/to/vmlinuz repo=hd:/dev/sdb1:/

For the above example, we put the iso file on root folder of a partition
accessible from the installer with (linux, not grub) device name /dev/sdb1.

3) Finally type 'boot' command to start installation. If everything is fine,
the GUI installer will start afterwards.

If the installer does not recognize target drive despite such effort, an
alternative way will be to attach the target drive (as USB drive, for
example) to another computer with better compatibility to perform the
installation. When installer finishes and prompts to reboot the system,
shutdown the computer, connect the target drive back to its original host,
then boot the newly installed partition.

rpm -i http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-23.noarch.rpm

# basic system groups
yum groupinstall "Mate" base-x

# system
yum install mariadb-server libreoffice telnet p7zip p7zip-plugins wget lsb \
  screen rdesktop mplayer gnome-mplayer ibus-pinyin NetworkManager-vpnc \

# for installing python packages
yum install gcc redhat-rpm-config mariadb-devel libxml2 libxslt libxml2-devel \

# for exfat support
yum install fuse-exfat exfat-utils

Special notes:
1. MPlayer and freetype-freeworld, exfat support are from rpmfusion.
2. alsa-plugins-pulseaudio is required for mplayer to play MP3 files normally.

Other software

+ AMD graphic driver
  + The latest official driver as of this write supports kernel up to 3.19.
    But Fedora 23 has 4.2.6. This means we will have to resort to the driver
    bundled with Fedora (xorg-x11-drv-ati), which just works. If there is
    anything wrong, check the Xorg log. In one occation, some fallback driver
    leads to display problem; uninstalled it and the problem disappeared.

+ Oracle JDK
+ Firefox
  + Bookmark Sync'ing
  + Plugins (@ ~/.mozilla/plugins):
    + Flash: downloaded from Adobe site; cp libflashplayer.so =>
    + Java: ln -s jdk/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so =>
  + Add-ons (can be sync'ed together with bookmarks):
    + 'EPUBReader'
    + 'FoxyProxy Standard',
    + 'Theme Font & Size Changer'
    + 'User Agent Switcher'
+ Google Chrome (extensions in the official store cannot be downloaded for
  offline use; has to be downloaded from sources elsewhere)
  + Extensions:
    + Ultimate User Agent Switcher, URL Sniffer
    + youkuhtml5player (http://zythum.sinaapp.com/youkuhtml5playerbookmark/)
+ Wine (specific version required for certain app) and .wine dir [1]
+ VMware View Client [2]
+ Fonts
+ Other open source software that we'd prefer to download and install all by
  ourselves (maven, scala, etc; mainly java based).
  + Those in yum repos will certain have openjdk as dependency. We use our own
    Oracle JDK and therefore has to maintain our own Java softwares.
+ Software available directly from git repos (notes, bypy, etc).

Configurations

vi /etc/selinux/config => disabled
cp .bash_profile .bashrc .gitconfig .gitignore .vimrc .my.cnf .ssh/config \
  .config/fontconfig/fonts.conf .m2/settings.xml .sbt/repositories \
  .sbt/0.13/plugins/build.sbt .gradle/gradle.properties \
  .gradle/init.d/artifactory.gradle .PyCharm50/config .IntelliJIdea15/config
  + Use this transfer technique to avoid the headache of directory hierarchies:
    + cd /mnt1/home/r/  # old home dir
    + tar -cf - xxx yyy | tar -xf - -C /home/r/ # to new home dir
cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config # multiple port, UseDNS no, etc.

# To boot into GUI login (remove destination file if it already exists)
ln -sf /usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target /etc/systemd/system/default.target

Additional Info

1. When doing netinstall, the installation source has to be specified as
   something like
