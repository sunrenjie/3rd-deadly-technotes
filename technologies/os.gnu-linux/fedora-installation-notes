Install Fedora GNU/Linux of our own taste

We keep installation and configuration info here to make further repeats
easier (targeting Fedora 23 by default unless otherwise mentioned explicitly).

==================================================
Installation of Fedora 23 from hard disk/USB drive

Steps:
0) Download the server iso file, put it on some ext/fat partition accessible
by the installer.

The installer seems to have weaker and weaker ability to recognize complex
partitions for installation targets, as version bumps. To avoid trouble, it
is better we put the installation ISO file on a disk that has very simple
partitioning scheme and contains no installation target partition. An USB
FAT32 thumb drive will be ideal.

1) Extract isolinux folder from the iso, put it somewhere accessible from
grub.

We typically use windows+grldr for bootstrapping the installation. In such
case, we might put it on any NTFS/FAT/EXT partition.

2) Boot computer with grub. load kernel/initrd from the isolinux folder. In
particular, the kernel command line shall be like:
kernel /path/to/vmlinuz repo=hd:/dev/sdb1:/

For the above example, we put the iso file on root folder of a partition
accessible from the installer with (linux, not grub) device name /dev/sdb1.

3) Finally type 'boot' command to start installation. If everything is fine,
the GUI installer will start afterwards.

If the installer does not recognize target drive despite such effort, an
alternative way will be to attach the target drive (as USB drive, for
example) to another computer with better compatibility to perform the
installation. When installer finishes and prompts to reboot the system,
shutdown the computer, connect the target drive back to its original host,
then boot the newly installed partition.

YUM Software packages

rpm fusion:
rpm -i http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-23.noarch.rpm
rpm -i http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-23.noarch.rpm

# basic system groups
yum groupinstall "Mate" base-x

# system
yum install mariadb-server libreoffice telnet p7zip p7zip-plugins wget lsb \
  screen rdesktop mplayer gnome-mplayer ibus-pinyin NetworkManager-vpnc \
  alsa-plugins-pulseaudio git freetype-freeworld

# ia32 support (wine, vmware-view, etc)
yum install gtk2.i686 gtk3.i686 libpng12.i686 alsa-lib.i686 gdk-pixbuf2.i686 \
  libxkbfile.i686 glibc.i686 cairo.i686 freetype-freeworld \
  freetype-freeworld.i686 gtk-murrine-engine.i686

# for installing python packages
yum install gcc-c++ redhat-rpm-config libxml2 libxslt libxml2-devel \
  libyaml-devel libxslt-devel python3-devel python-devel python-virtualenv

# for exfat support
yum install fuse-exfat exfat-utils

# input method; originally we use ibus-pinyin, but it is buggy.
yum install fcitx-pinyin fcitx-configtool

Special notes:
1. MPlayer and freetype-freeworld, exfat support are from rpmfusion.
2. alsa-plugins-pulseaudio is required for mplayer to play MP3 files normally.
3. The package system has the special feature that upon a successful
installation RPM download cache is cleared, no matter whether they are
installed or not. When installing a large number of packages and conflicts
come up after downloading, we would merrily solve the conflicts. If that
conflict resolution process involves successful installation of some packages
(it shall typically do!), the cache will be cleared. After that, when we
we re-run the installation, we will have to enjoy downloading the RPM files
again!
4. The classical Linux bug of vim-minimal conflict persists.
5. Also remains the group install bug of erroneously believing a group of rpm
packages is installed while actually it isn't. In which case, examine the list
of packages within the group, construct a command to install them all.
6. Now mirrors.aliyun.com is much usable than mirrors.ustc.edu.cn.

Other software

+ AMD graphic driver
  + Follow the instructions at the page:
    https://bluehatrecord.wordpress.com/2016/03/25/installing-the-proprietary-amd-crimson-driver-on-fedora-23-with-linux-kernel-4-4-6-300/
+ JDK
  + Avoid OpenJDK, always use Oracle JDK as much as possible. One prominent
    difference is font-rendering of Jetbrains Intellij Idea.
+ Firefox
  + Change the UI font: cd to the profile dir, create sub-folder chrome,
    create a userChrome.css file there with the content:
    * { font-family: "Ubuntu" !important; }
  + Bookmark Sync'ing: just login and done.
  + Plugins:
    + Flash: downloaded from Adobe site; cp libflashplayer.so =>
      ~/.mozilla/plugins
  + Add-ons (can be sync'ed together with bookmarks):
    + 'Abduction!-FIXED' and 'Easy Screenshot': these two plugins allow to
      save the whole or partial part of the web page to image. We are yet to
      figure out which is better.
    + 'EPUBReader'
    + 'FoxyProxy Standard',
    + 'Theme Font & Size Changer'
    + 'User Agent Switcher'
+ Google Chrome (extensions in the official store cannot be downloaded for
  offline use; has to be downloaded from sources elsewhere)
  + Plugins
    + Flash: as of version google-chrome-stable-54.0.2840.100-1.x86_64, we
      have to download flash plugin separately from Adobe site. Extract the
      .tar.gz file, copy libpepflashplayer.so and manifest.json to some
      folder (for convenience, we use chrome's installation directory;
      /opt/google/chrome/), then modify the start-up script google-chrome (in
      installation dir) to add option to the 'chrome' binary to point to the
      flash program:
      '--ppapi-flash-path=/opt/google/chrome/libpepflashplayer.so' [3].
  + Extensions:
    + Ultimate User Agent Switcher, URL Sniffer
    + ...
+ Wine (specific version required for certain app) and .wine dir [1]
+ VMware View Client [2]
+ Fonts
+ Other open source software that we'd prefer to download and install all by
  ourselves (maven, scala, etc; mainly java based).
  + Those in yum repos will certain have openjdk as dependency. We use our own
    Oracle JDK and therefore has to maintain our own Java softwares.
+ Software available directly from git repos (notes, bypy, etc).

search keyword flash in this page; the method is described in a comment.

Configurations

vi /etc/selinux/config => disabled

Transfer of config files from old system to a new one:
cp .bash_profile .bashrc .gitconfig .gitignore .vimrc .my.cnf \
  .config/fontconfig/fonts.conf .m2/settings.xml .sbt/repositories \
  .sbt/0.13/plugins/build.sbt .gradle/gradle.properties \
  .gradle/init.d/artifactory.gradle
  + Use this transfer technique to make things easier (folder hierarchy
    respected, symlinks kept not dereferenced, time stamps left untouched):
    + cd /mnt1/home/r/  # old home dir
    + tar -cf - xxx yyy | tar -xf - -C /home/r/ # to new home dir
cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config # multiple port, UseDNS no, etc.

# To boot into GUI login (remove destination file if it already exists)
ln -sf /usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target /etc/systemd/system/default.target

Start-up applications:
The start-up application feature allows us to run GUI related start-up programs.
Currently we have:
+ fcitx (has to export variables in .bash_profile in advance)
+ touch screen and monitor assignment (Toshiba P50b):
  xinput --map-to-output $(xinput --list | grep 'ELAN Touchscreen' | \
    grep -o 'id=[0-9]*' | awk -F '=' '{print $2}') eDP1

Additional Info

1. When doing netinstall, the installation source has to be specified as
   something like
   http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/fedora/linux/releases/23/Everything/x86_64/os/
   !!!
