How to configure ibus-pinyin after installation in linux:

if [ ! "$XMODIFIERS" = "@im=ibus" ] ; then
  export XMODIFIERS="@im=ibus"
  export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
  export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
  ibus-daemon -d
fi

Practically, the ibus-daemon command has to run when the GUI is up. That
means at least they cannot be placed in ~/.bash_profile. On Gnome/Mate desktop,
we could perfectly solve the problem by adding ibus-daemon to
'Startup Applications'.
