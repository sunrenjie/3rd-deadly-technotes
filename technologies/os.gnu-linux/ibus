How to configure ibus-pinyin after installation in linux:

if [ ! "$XMODIFIERS" = "@im=ibus" ] ; then
  export XMODIFIERS="@im=ibus"
  export GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
  export QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
  ibus-daemon -d
fi

Practically, the ibus-daemon command has to run when the GUI is up. That
means at least they cannot be placed in ~/.bash_profile. On Gnome/Mate desktop,
we could perfectly solve the problem by adding ibus-daemon to
'Startup Applications'.

One addition notice is that ibus-daemon has to run in a environment whose
first python executable in PATH is NOT created by virtualenv; otherwise
the "Preferences" window cannot be opened. It turns out that virtualenv python
fails to add '/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/gtk-2.0' to its path. The
program behind the "Preferences" window is written in python that uses 'gi'
package from the above path. It will not run with virtualenv'ed python. The
conclusion therefore, use specialized prepared PATH when opening up ibus for
configuration.
