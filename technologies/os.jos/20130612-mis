We will restart the project of the jos operating system as introduced in the
course MIT 6.828 Operating System Engineering.

About developing environment
We will build the OS of gcc+binutils cross-compiling toolchain on mac and run
the OS in the bochs simulator.

TODO: Our i386-elf-gcc installed via macports failed to generate adequate
obj/boot/main.o to allow obj/boot/boot to fit in a 512 byte boot sector. The
reason is unknown. The temp fix is to copy a known boot sector. In the long run,
however, we would want to remove the 512 byte requirement so that we do not have
to resort to an external boot sector and could have more powerful and robust
bootstrap options. UPDATE: fixed by adding '-j' option to objcopy.
