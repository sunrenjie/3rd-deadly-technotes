JOS pipe structure as defined in lib/pipe.c:

22 struct Pipe {
23      off_t p_rpos;           // read position
24      off_t p_wpos;           // write position
25      uint8_t p_buf[PIPEBUFSIZ];      // data buffer
26 };
...
44      // allocate the pipe structure as first data page in both
45      va = fd2data(fd0);
...
197 static int
198 pipeclose(struct Fd *fd)
199 {
200     return sys_page_unmap(0, fd2data(fd));
201 }

Notes:
1. The one-and-only internal data structure maintained by the two Fd structures
   at both ends is the pipe structure shared by both. It is allocated in pipe()
   and deallocated in pipeclose() (when, of course, the reference count drops
   to zero, at which time both ends of the pipe are closed). For simplicity, it
   is placed at the 1st page of data in both Fd.
2. The Fd structures are deallocated by fd_close() in lib/fd.c.
