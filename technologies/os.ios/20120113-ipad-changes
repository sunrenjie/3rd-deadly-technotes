Changes made to my iPad (iOS 4.3.3)

1. Jailbreaked (http://www.jailbreakme.com) with several software installed from
   Cydia: openSSH server, apt-get
2. Changed the root passwd according to Cydia's recommendation.
3. Now ready to copy the first 'hello world' C program to it to run.
4. Compiled and installed (to /usr/local/) the following GNU software:
   coreutils, sed, awk, wget


More info about my iPad2:
1. Apple Applications are installed at /Applications/;
   others at /private/var/mobile/Applications/

2. nandu-daily is installed at 88697BE7-368D-4FF6-807F-55302E2B351F

3. nanfang renwu zhoukan is installed at C5279B77-B83A-425D-9147-D1004011A2B2

This app doubles disk usage in the way that it keeps both an archived .mag file
and extracted contents for each issue. We could move all .mag files out.

5. scripting-based statistics

All files are written to /Applications/Utilities/.

# pwd=/private/var/mobile/Applications/
# figure out which apps have too many files
ls -1 | awk 'BEGIN{n=1}{print n "\t" $1; n++}' | sed 1,66d | while read l;do du -hs $l; done

# generate du report for all apps
du -s * > /Applications/Utilities/apps.du-s

# generate mapping between apps and dirs:
cat /Applications/Utilities/apps.du-s | sort -k 1n | while read l; do
  arr=($l)
  usage=${arr[0]}
  dir=${arr[1]}
  app=`echo /private/var/mobile/Applications/$dir/*.app`
  echo -e "$usage\t$dir\t$app"
done > /Applications/Utilities/apps.lst

# 20120331
# a better way to map app to dir:
echo /private/var/mobile/Applications/*/*.app | sed 's:\.app :.app\n:g'

# Now we have managed to install lighttpd+php5, brought up the http server,
# along with the whole bunch of documentation: intel i386, php+python+perl,
# gcc+gdb+stab, mit6.828, etc, finally managed to read html dox on iPad.

# Perl is installed by following instructions at this page:
# http://www.perkiset.org/forum/index.php?action=printpage;topic=2892.0
# With the help of lighttpd+perl, we managed to automatically login to FT.com
# using an account chosen arbitrarily from our free FT.com account pool.
