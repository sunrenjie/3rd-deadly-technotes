Users, tenants (previously known as projects), and roles

A user is an entity that can be a person, system, or service.

A tenant is a user group. A system typically have at least the tenants admin and
services. Based on the accessible services and/or identy objects, a tenant is
usually defined to contain some types of users. We may create an 'admin' tenant
to contain the user 'admin', an 'services' tenent to contain the openstack
services glance, nova, neutron, etc. A role is an personality that a user
assumes that enables them to perform a specific set of operations. A user may
have more than one roles.

Users always log in with a tenant, and roles are assigned to users within tenants.

Implementation details:
+ For my installation of openstack 2013.2.2, all users have to have the role
  '_member_' in order to be able to access dashboard (confirmed by doc).
+ The term 'project' is deprecated in favor of 'tenant', yet it still prevails
  in existing doc and even code:
  nova/api/openstack/wsgi.py:983: msg = _("Malformed request URL: URL's project_id '%(project_id)s'"
