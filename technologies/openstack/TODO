Questions, Notes
+ Tests are good examples of using code functionalities.
+ How is tested performed by testr?
+ How to manually run some tests so that we could examine data structures
  and/or debug them.
+ There are configurations and other stuff that should be considered in order
  to do so.
+ When armed with better knowledges, tools, ideas, we should come back to
  analyze some changes more deeply:
  + Id4dff993
    + NeutronManager.get_plugin()
    + server.capabilities()
    + mock.patch()
