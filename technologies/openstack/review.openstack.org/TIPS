Q: What to do when the commit you wish to study is totally alien to you?
A: At least you could do the following:
   0) Don't panic; for any of the possibly awesome steps, repeat until you
      are thru.
   1) Work on pieces one by one; keep going slowly yet steadily; now and then
      try to get abstract idea from the change.
   2) Figure out the data structure / database table in question (there is
      likely to be a one since this change is a quite complex one); find all
      its usage.
   3) Read relevant bug report and / or commit message thoroughly, till you
      digests them.
   4) If the diff is bewilding, understand present code or previous code
      first. That helps.

Questions for you in case you do not have a clue:
+ What is this change is about? (hint: describe the blueprint or bug if
  applicable)
+ How does the change essentially evolves all the way, from the first change to
  the latest one?
+ How is this change implemented? (hint: code quality: cleanness,
  extensibility)
+ What is the impact this change implies?
+ Is there any possible improvement?
+ How do you understand interesting phrase or wording of the commit message?
+ What's more that can be said?
Considerations in raising questions and hence answering them:
+ The necessity of the change shall be addressed partially by description of
  the blueprint/bug (what about) and partially by how is the change
  implemented.
