Closes-Bug: #1297145

Bug Description

L3 agent uses deprecated root_helper option through self.conf.root_helper in
neutron.agent.l3_agent.L3NATAgent._update_routing_table instead of using
self.root_helper (result of neutron.agent.common.config.get_root_helper.

It implies if AGENT/root_helper option is configured and root_helper is not
configured, extra routes are not pushed in routers.

Notes:
1. This is typically a deprecation problem. An option is considered inadequate,
   an alternative is adopted, deprecating the original one. Unfortunately, code
   relying on this feature does not get updated. In this particular case, the
   problem has been spotted the harder way. Someone accidentally found that
   routing table updating won't work as expected. Then some tracking identified
   this problem as a bug.
2. [context] Configuration files are read by oslo.config into cfg.CONF, from
   which wrapper functions can then be used to extract particular config info.
   The config in this case is root_helper, provider of sudo (and possibly more)
   functionality. Previously, it is at the DEFAULT section in neutron.conf.
   Later someone else decided to move it to agent section and provide
   get_root_helper() for accessing this config. This change recognizes
   root_helper in DEFAULT section as compatibility. Yet the code in
   _update_routing_table() still access the cfg.CONF directly. Now that by
   default the configuration file does not have root_helper in agent section,
   this function will not be able to get sudo and do its work (updating the
   routine table).
3. [summary] This is a bug introduced by a previous change that failed to
   update affected code as well. It is hard to imagine that there is only one
   affected piece of code, yet this one just failed to attract attention when
   that previous change was made.
3. This is one of the changes that make little change in code, yet is related
   to a much larger problem.
