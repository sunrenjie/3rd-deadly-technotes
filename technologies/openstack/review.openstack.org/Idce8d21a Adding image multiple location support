We came across the patch sets ID Idce8d21a at the top of merged list. After a
little analysis, we found this is a fundamental improvement addressing the bug
reported at https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1226351

Interestingly, the initial work started at Jun 18, 2013 while the bug is
reported at Sep 17, 2013, three months earlier. The project must have been
targetting a larger and more generic problem.

There are actually a total of four patch sets targetting this bug:
https://review.openstack.org/#/q/project:openstack/nova+branch:master+topic:bug/1226351,n,z
Of them,  (as of Mar 5, 2014) 1 is merged, 1 abandoned, and 2 likely to be
accepted.

Such lengthy and complicated stories make the project and bug so interesting.

Turned out that the real problem with this project can be reflected by this

Patch Set 45: I would prefer that you didn't merge this

Without even looking at the patch itself, -1 because:

* patch is too big: we generally aim for 500 lines or less
* BP isn't approved

The author is preparing a all-in-one patch that does just about everything,
effectively away from  requirements stated in blueprints. To sum up, this is
a good counterexample of cooperative open source development.
