    Delete subnet fails if assoc port has IPs from another subnet
    
    This change fixes the following failure scenario:
    - Create a network
    - Create two subnets on the network
    - Create a port on the network using one of the subnets
    - Delete the other subnet
    = = = > FAILURE: Subnet delete fails because supposedly there
    is/are port(s) still associated with that subnet.
    
    The problem addressed is that delete_subnet() in
    neutron/db/db_base_plugin.py is checking for port(s) still being
    associated with the subnet's network, not the subnet itself.
    
    Change-Id: I7adbe18cce412135b2e42dcb7c592e60c1ec5f8f
    Closes-Bug: #1281694

Notes:
1. This change is quite straightforward: use more appropriate filters
   according to the purpose. But L.1241 is a big concern; see comments.

Do we still need to filter by network_id? One subnet belongs to only one
network and we already narrow IPAllocaiton by subnet_id at L.1239.

The change was made from patch set 2 to 3, but I am not sure why
filter_by(network_id) is required. Let me clarfiy.

_______________________________ Lee Li		Mar 29

I agree. It's not need to filter by network_id.

I am far from being any kind of expert on database queries, but the two filters
seem correct to me. There are two tables being filtered separately and then
joined for the final result. IPAllocations are filtered by subnet and Ports are
filtered by network. If I am wrong on this, please educate me.

I checked more detail. In this case we need to consider with_lockmode at the
next line. L.1241 is required to make 'FOR UPDATE' work for ports. Without
this, related ports are not locked for update. As a conclusion, L.1241 is
required.

(For a case without with_lockmode, L.1241 filter_by is unnecessary.)

Thanks,
