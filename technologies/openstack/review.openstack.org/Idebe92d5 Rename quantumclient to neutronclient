We comment on this change only because it is a perfect counterexample of bad
commits.

The main purpose of this commit is to reflect the change of the openstack
networking component from 'quantum' to 'neutron'. But this and this commit
'Change I54b6912e: Add name or id to quantum cli commands. Bug #1030180'
together make the file 'quantum_test.sh' nearly rubbish. For convenience, we
will quote this change only here, though actually the problems are rooted in
change 'I54b6912e'.

1. The purpose, design, or implementation of 'neutron_test.sh' is not obvious
   either from file name or from documentation (there is none), or inline
   comments (there is rare). The code is in ad hoc mode ever since it was born.
2. The code is incorrect. The 'cidr' of '10.0.1.0/24' is invalid. The option
   '--dns-nameservers' is misspelled as '--dns_namesevers'. All these stuff were
   from 'Change I54b6912e' and are inheriented by this change.
3. Both these changes are tested OK and accepted simply because functionality of
   this script is not covered by the automated test: not used for testing and
   not subject to testing.

Finally, the most rediculous part about this silly story is that the whole
world saw it, yet ignored.
