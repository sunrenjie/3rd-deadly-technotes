Full installation guide

1. Copy the template to path of the hard disk image of the VM.
2. Boot VM.
3. Preliminary configurations: installation of 2nd nic, setting of host name,
   installation of ssh keys (for password-less authtication), installation of
   bashrc-local(-sudo) which will do a lot of other configuration tasks
   and install notes repo.
4. Install devstack.
5. Post-installation configurations: install config files for br-ex and 1st
   nic.


======================
Questions and Problems

1. Possible reasons that VMs cannot be accessed from another VM or host node:
   + MTU may need to be set to a value below of 1500 (e.g., 1450). Solution:
     set it lower via command line (or is there more automatic method?).
   + Fedora sshd configuration has password authentication disabled by
     default. Solution: modify sshd_config and restart the ssd service.

2. Updates in devstack repo make our existing installation methods less
   inefficient.

3. The various post-installation openstack-specific functions need update.

4. When we want to access VM via floating ip, we essentially need to execute
   'ip nei del' again and again.
