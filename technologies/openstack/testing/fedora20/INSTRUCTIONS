Instructions for installing openstack on fedora 20 vm in kvm+qemu

_______________________________________
To create a seed (preliminary) vm image

# create hard disk
qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o preallocation=metadata -o cluster_size=2M f20.qcow2 20G

# install from dvd
sudo virt-install --connect qemu:///system -n f18 -r 4096 --vcpus=4 \
  --accelerate -v --os-variant=fedora20 -c Fedora-18-x86_64-DVD.iso \
  -w bridge:br0,model=e1000 --vnc --disk \
  path=f18.qcow2,cache=none,format=qcow2,bus=virtio

virsh edit f20 and add
    <filesystem type='mount' accessmode='mapped'>
      <source dir='/home/r'/>
      <target dir='host0'/>
    </filesystem>

##################################
# scp my id_rsa.pub to vm as ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with proper permission.

# make backup
qemu-img convert -c -f qcow2 -O qcow2 -o cluster_size=2M f20.qcow2 \
  f20-clone.qcow2

NOTE:
0. The package vim-minimal shall be updated first. This allows vim (and hence
   rabbitmq-server) to be installed without conflict complaint.
1. A second stage seed vm image for devstack can be made by pre-installing
   dependent packages as revealed by log file generated a pilot installation
   attempt (for example, see packages-preinstalled-for-devstack). For rdo
   packstack, the only one difference is that it uses different database;
   therefore, the packages mariadb mariadb-libs mariadb-server shall be
   removed to avoid conflicts.
2. If you wish to change hostname, do that at early as possible, at least
   before installation of openstack.
3. Always note the user/tenant you use for different tasks. For example, on
   RDO packstack installation, demo user shall be used to create vm as network
   setting is inadequate for admin user. We spent 4 or 5 days to figure this
   out.

________________________________________
To create a two-node openstack configuration

1. Have available two nics (say, eth0, eth1) in the Linux host.
2. Create two bridges br0, br1. Add eth0 and eth1 to br0 and br1 respectively.
   If further nodes are to be added, create a network that connects all the
   nodes. Now network to which eth0 is connected will be the external one,
   while the network to which eth1 is connected will be the internal one.
3. Install openstack modules on these nodes. For RDO packstack, there is an
   official page describing the procedure. For devstack, local.conf for
   controller and compute node is created in my devstack git repo.
4. If you cannot ping the VM via the floating IP, execute tcpdump on the host
   of the VM once and the problem disappears; do not know why.
