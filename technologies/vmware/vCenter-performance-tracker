vCenter performance tracker (vCPT)

vCPT: a reliable, quantitive vCenter performance tracker.

=====================
Implementation status

[bp1]
1. Collect all possible historical data.

===========
Definitions

Roles:
1. Collect and store historical and real-time performance data reliably and
   permanantly.
   vCenter only only store real-time performance data for the last hour.
   Some critical performance data, say per-vmnic throughput, is only available
   as real-time data.
   
   The difference is in anology to TCP vs. UDP.
2. Really reliable performance tracking. vCenter server performance module
   offers a best-effort functionality. In fact, even vCenter server itself is
   allowed to be down while the data center continues to work.
3. Flexible and really user-defined performance reporting. vCPT is designed
   to quantify the painpoints of your really highly professional and
   sophisticated vCenter management. The engineers are heavy vCenter users.
   They know that to pinpoint the obsecure reason behind a wierd problem, we
   really need a solution more than generic. EXCELs, graphs, etc? Not enough.
   Actually, an perfect combination of all that we could imagine.
   In contrast, vCenter only allow charts.
   vCOPS is essentially a high level monitor; not quantitive.
   vCOPS supports csv export, but no customization. And vCOPS license fee is really high.

Modules:
1. Data collector daemon.
2. Data storage engine.
3. Data access API.
4. Performance analyzers (API consumers).

==============================
vCenter knowledge that matters

From the performance point of view, the most commonly accessed inventory is
'Hosts and Clusters'.
+ vCenter node
  + Data center 1
    + Cluster 1
    + Cluster 2
      + Hosts
        + Host 1
        + Host 2
        + ...
      + Resource pool (unamed; root)
        + VM1
        + VM2
        + ...
        + Resource pool sub1
          + VMx
          + VMy
        + Resource pool sub2
        + ...
    + ...
  + Data center 2
  + ...

There are two types of vCenter performance data: historical and real time.

Historical data is whatever vCenter knows about in the history. It contains
data points as old as a year ago, as long as vCenter has run such a long time
and has been allowed to store them all along.

Real-time data is what vCenter collects very recently (normally the last hour).

In order not to present too high a burden for vCenter server, historical data
is collected typically at every day or every week (or several days, as
appropriate in the vCenter environment).

=====================
Data collector daemon

Definition for data:
1. vCenter performance data (available in the 'Performance' tab).
2. All meaningful configuration, status, events, changes, etc.
   vCenter performance Data collected shall only be meaningful together with
   these data. [XXX: please elaborate on this based on realistic scenaros.

vCenter historical and real-time data are collected in different manners.

Real-time data is expensive; choose this version only for good reasons.
1. Data is real-time only. For example, per-vmnic RX/TX data.
2. Real-time version is superior.
