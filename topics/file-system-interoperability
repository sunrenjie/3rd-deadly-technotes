On File System Interoperability

We use different types of file systems in different operating systems.
Routine data exchange among them raises the problem of interoperability. In
one of the worst catastrophe recently, writing a FAT partition by Mac OS X
resulted in deleting of one huge (>500GB) NTFS partition, on which majority
of our data is stored. In minor cases, writing of NTFS partitions by Linux
resulted in data loss and/or file system error.

These disasters urge us to work out some SOPs on exchanging data on the
various file systems. To be brief, in order to ensure maximum safely, we shall
only write to file systems for which native support is available,
except with good reasons. Read support shall be deployed as much as possible
to help us figure out workaround solutions when there is a need to write to
file systems without native support.

When is support for some file system native? Its OS vendor invented it,
shipped it in the OS (and hence having tested it extremely heavily behind the
scene), held relevant patents around it (if there is any).

Here are the detailed Does and Don'ts:

File System    Windows    Linux    Mac OS X
NTFS           RW         RO [1]   RO
FAT*           RW         RO [1]   RO [1]
ext2/3/4       RO [2]     RW       NA
Apple HPFS     RO [3]     RO [1]   RW

Notes: Reference OS'es are XP/7 for Windows, Fedora 20/21 x86_64 for Linux,
Mac OS X 10.9. Abbreviations: 'RW' for native read/write support (we forbid
non-native write anyway), 'RO' for read only, 'NA' for unavailable (even if
commecial solutions are available). Reading support for all file systems as
listed are available in Windows, meaning that Windows/NTFS is the ideal
combination to manipulate/store our data, while Windows/FAT may seems better
for small-capacity USB thumb drives or SD/TF cards.

Also:
[1] Official yet not native write support may trick us to use it and hurt us.
    Always disabled it. Majority of data/file system corruption happens in
    such cases.
[2] Read only support is available via third-party software ext2fsd.
[3] Read only support is available via Apple bootcamp or third-party software
    HFSExplorer.

* There are several FAT variants: FAT/FAT32/exFAT, etc. Now that they are
  under similar situations in our discussion, we don't bother to distinguish
  among them.

Once again, always disable write for non-native support. If there is absolute
necessity, give remote file system (say, NFS) a try.
